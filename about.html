      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        Nicholas D. Miller, known professionally as Illenium, is an American
        musician, DJ, and record producer. He has released three studio albums
        with his most recent, Ascend, being released in August 2019 on
        Astralwerks. That album was Illenium's first to top the Billboard
        Dance/Electronic Albums chart and also reached his highest peak on the
        Billboard 200 at number 14. Several of his songs have also appeared on
        the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart including two 2019
        singles that peaked at number 3: "Good Things Fall Apart" with Jon
        Bellion and "Takeaway" with The Chainsmokers (featuring Lennon Stella).
        Illenium has also worked on numerous notable remixes, including those
        for The Chainsmokers' "Don't Let Me Down" and Flume's "Say It", the
        latter of which won the award for "Remix of the Year" at the inaugural
        Electronic Music Awards in 2017.
